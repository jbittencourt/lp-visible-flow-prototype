=Introduction=

The *Learnable Programming Visible Flow Prototype* is a project developed as an assignment for the *CMP586 â€“ Trends in Software Engineering* computer science post-grad course at II-UFRGS.

The main objective of the software is to prototype some ideas present by [Bret's Victor Learnable Programming essay](http://worrydream.com/LearnableProgramming/). We focus specifically in investigating how to make the execution flow visible for the programmer.
